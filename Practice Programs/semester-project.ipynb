    "The last two weeks (including the final exam time) will be spent on final projects and presentations. You may develop, solve, and present a computational model. Or, you may review and solve models in the literature, comparing your results to expected results. In this way, you will be able to select and solve a computational model of your interest.\n",

    "There are five categories that the project's grade is based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. level of difficulty\n",
    "  - How does your project compare to a typical unit project performed in this class in terms of difficulty? It should be more difficult than a typical unit project.\n",

    "1. level of creativity\n",
    "  - Is your project interesting?\n",
    "  - What novel ideas did you have?\n",
    "1. level of independence\n",
    "  - What % of your project did you write and what % was based on others' work?\n",
    "  - Did you use example code or project ideas from others and did you cite their work?\n",
    "  - What aspects of the project were uniquely yours?\n",
    "1. completeness\n",
    "  - Did your program work?\n",
    "  - Did you \"go the extra mile\" to achieve excellence in your project?\n",
    "  - Are there clear areas of your project that you should have done to make the project more interesting or more useful?\n",
    "  - Did you clearly state your goal and did you clearly achieve your goal?\n",
    "1. quality of your presentation\n",
    "  - A separate rubric will be used for the presentation.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Presentations of projects will be on Friday, Dec 7, 3:00 â€“ 6:00PM. Your project should be in a notebook and should be presented with the RISE package. I've created a [Jupyter tutorial](https://github.com/atitus/Jupyter-Tutorials/blob/master/11%20Giving%20a%20Presentation%20in%20Jupyter.ipynb) to install RISE.\n",
